# Notes
    - See how Gemini flags content

## Todo
    -Fix how gemini handles profanity
    - Impliment something where if content is inapropriate, it gets flagged, and sent to a moderator
        - Need to figure out how to hide the comment until it is deemed appropriate by a moderator
        - Show a modal instead of a wp_die    
    -Add a TLDR summary
    - Add a feature that gives the ai all of the context of the thread
